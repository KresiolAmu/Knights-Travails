# Knights-Travails

A project based on theodinproject.com curriculum. The idea of this project is to apply a search algorithm on graph data structure to find the shortest path possible from point A to point B. The concept of this project is simulate the movement of the knight on a chessboard and traverse the graph to calculate the most efficient route from starting point to the end point. This project uses Breadth-First Search to traverse all possible neighbor vertices until it reach the desired destination.
